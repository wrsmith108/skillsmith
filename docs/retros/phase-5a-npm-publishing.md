# Phase 5A: npm Publishing Pipeline - Retrospective

> ⚠️ **HISTORICAL DOCUMENT**
>
> This retrospective documents Phase 5A (January 2025). The license model was updated in January 2026:
> - License: **Apache-2.0 → Elastic License 2.0**
> - See [ADR-013](../adr/013-open-core-licensing.md) for current licensing.

**Date**: January 4, 2025
**Duration**: ~45 minutes
**Issues**: SMI-1048, SMI-1049, SMI-1050, SMI-1051, SMI-1052

## Summary

Implemented the npm publishing infrastructure for Skillsmith packages, enabling the free tier to be published to public npm and enterprise package to GitHub Packages.

## Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Files Created | 5 |
| Files Modified | 5 |
| Issues Completed | 5 |
| Code Review Status | PASS |

## What Went Well

1. **Clear separation of packages** - Public (Apache-2.0) vs private (Proprietary) clearly delineated
2. **Workflow design** - Dependency order ensures core publishes before dependents
3. **Documentation** - npm-setup.md provides complete setup instructions
4. **Code review caught issues** - Identified missing timeout, broken link, and missing bugs field

## What Could Be Improved

1. **Enterprise README missing initially** - Should have been created with LICENSE.md
2. **Timeout-minutes** - Should be standard on all workflow jobs, not just validate
3. **Manual setup required** - npm org and tokens still require manual steps

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always create README for packages** - Even proprietary packages need documentation
2. **Add timeouts to all CI jobs** - Prevents hung workflows
3. **Code review before merge** - Catches issues like broken links that are easy to miss
4. **Document manual steps clearly** - npm org/token setup requires user action

## Changes Made

### Package Configuration

| Package | Changes |
|---------|---------|
| `@skillsmith/core` | Added prepublishOnly, repository, homepage, bugs, keywords |
| `@skillsmith/mcp-server` | Added prepublishOnly, repository, homepage, bugs, keywords |
| `@skillsmith/cli` | Added prepublishOnly, files, license, repository, homepage, bugs, keywords |
| `@skillsmith/enterprise` | Added prepublishOnly, LICENSE.md, README.md, publishConfig, bugs |

### Workflow

- Created `.github/workflows/publish.yml`
- Triggers on release or manual dispatch
- Validates before publishing
- Publishes in correct dependency order
- Summary job reports results

### Documentation

- Created `docs/publishing/npm-setup.md`
- Covers npm org setup, token generation, GitHub secrets
- Troubleshooting section for common issues

## Next Steps

| Item | Priority | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Create npm org | High | Manual: Create @skillsmith org on npmjs.com |
| Generate npm token | High | Manual: Create automation token for CI |
| Add NPM_TOKEN secret | High | Manual: Add to GitHub repository secrets |
| Test dry run | Medium | Run workflow with dry_run to verify |
| First release | Medium | Create v0.1.0 release to publish |
| Phase 5B: Licensing | High | Implement LicenseValidator per ADR-014 |
