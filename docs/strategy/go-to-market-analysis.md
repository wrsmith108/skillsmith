# Skillsmith Go-to-Market Analysis

**Date**: January 4, 2026
**Status**: Draft for Review
**Author**: Strategy Review
**Revision**: 2.0 - Feature Bifurcation Model

---

## Executive Summary

This document analyzes Skillsmith's commercialization strategy using the Shreyas Doshi product framework, comparing against Docker and Hugging Face reference models.

**Key Strategy: Feature Bifurcation (Not Usage Limits)**

Unlike usage-based models that throttle activity, Skillsmith uses a **feature bifurcation** approach:
- **Community tier**: Full access to all core features, unlimited usage, forever free
- **Team tier**: Collaboration and team features
- **Enterprise tier**: Security, compliance, and governance features

This mirrors the Docker model (core engine free, tooling paid) rather than the Hugging Face model (usage credits).

---

## Part 1: Shreyas Doshi Framework Analysis

### 1.1 LNO Framework (Leverage, Neutral, Overhead)

**High Leverage Activities for Skillsmith:**
| Activity | Leverage | Why |
|----------|----------|-----|
| npm package quality | High | First impression, drives adoption |
| Free tier completeness | High | No "gotcha" limits builds trust |
| Enterprise feature depth | High | SSO/audit/RBAC drive enterprise deals |
| Documentation | High | Reduces support burden |
| Community building | Medium | Network effects |
| Custom integrations | Low | One-off work, doesn't scale |

**Recommendation**: Focus on making the free tier genuinely complete and useful, while building deep enterprise value.

### 1.2 Pre-Mortem: Why Skillsmith Commercialization Could Fail

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Free tier "good enough" for enterprises | Medium | Critical | Enterprise features (SSO, RBAC, audit) are genuinely required by regulated industries |
| No technical enforcement of paid features | High | High | Implement feature gating via license validation |
| Enterprise sales cycle too long | Medium | High | Product-led growth with self-serve Team tier |
| Open source fork | Low | Medium | Apache-2.0 allows forks; proprietary enterprise is the moat |
| Developers resist recommending paid tier | Medium | Medium | Keep free tier unlimited; only charge for enterprise needs |

### 1.3 High-Leverage Decisions

**Decision 1: Monetization Model**
- **Option A**: Usage limits (like Hugging Face) - Free up to X calls/month
- **Option B**: Feature bifurcation (like Docker) - Core free, features paid
- **Recommendation**: **Option B** - Feature bifurcation is clearer and avoids friction

**Decision 2: What Triggers Payment**
- Individual developer need: Never (Community tier is complete)
- Team collaboration need: Team tier ($25/user/month)
- Enterprise compliance need: Enterprise tier ($55/user/month)
- **Recommendation**: Payment only triggered by organizational requirements, not individual usage

**Decision 3: Enforcement Mechanism**
- Features behind license validation (JWT-based per ADR-014)
- No rate limiting or usage quotas
- Clear feature boundaries, not artificial restrictions
- **Recommendation**: Technical enforcement via feature flags in license JWT

## Part 2: Reference Model Comparison

### 2.1 Docker Model (Feature-Based)

| Aspect | Docker | Skillsmith Proposed | Alignment |
|--------|--------|---------------------|-----------|
| Free tier definition | Docker Engine: unlimited | Core packages: unlimited | Aligned |
| What's paid | Docker Desktop for companies | Team/Enterprise features | Aligned |
| Enforcement | Company size threshold | License key for features | Different (technical vs legal) |
| Community perception | Positive (engine stays free) | Expected positive | Target |

**Docker Lessons Applied:**
- Keep the core engine (skill discovery, install) completely free
- Monetize the enterprise wrapper (SSO, RBAC, audit)
- No usage limits that frustrate developers
- Enterprise features justify themselves (compliance requirements)

### 2.2 Hugging Face Model (Usage-Based)

| Aspect | Hugging Face | Skillsmith Decision | Why Different |
|--------|--------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Free tier | Limited inference credits | Unlimited core usage | Avoid friction |
| Enforcement | Rate limits, 429 errors | Feature gating only | Better DX |
| Upgrade trigger | Credit exhaustion | Feature need | Organic, not forced |
| Community perception | Positive (generous free) | Target positive | No limits = trust |

**Hugging Face Lessons NOT Applied:**
- Usage-based pricing creates friction with individual developers
- Rate limits frustrate power users and create negative sentiment
- Credit exhaustion feels punitive rather than value-driven

### 2.3 Skillsmith Model: Feature Bifurcation

## Part 5: Technical Implementation

### 5.1 Feature Gating Architecture

```typescript
// No usage limits, only feature flags
interface License {
  tier: 'community' | 'team' | 'enterprise';
  features: FeatureFlag[];
  // No usage quotas!
}

type FeatureFlag =
  | 'team_workspaces'
  | 'private_skills'
  | 'usage_analytics'
  | 'priority_support'
  | 'sso_saml'
  | 'rbac'
  | 'audit_logging'
  | 'siem_export'
  | 'compliance_reports'
  | 'private_registry';

// Feature check middleware (not rate limit check)
function requireFeature(feature: FeatureFlag) {
  return async (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    const license = await getLicense(req.user);

    if (!license.hasFeature(feature)) {
      return res.status(403).json({
        error: 'FEATURE_NOT_AVAILABLE',
        feature,
        requiredTier: getRequiredTier(feature),
        currentTier: license.tier,
        // Core features still work!
        coreFeatures: 'All core features remain fully functional',
        upgradeUrl: `https://skillsmith.app/${getRequiredTier(feature)}`
      });
    }

    next();
  };
}

// Feature-to-tier mapping
const FEATURE_TIERS: Record<FeatureFlag, Tier[]> = {
  'team_workspaces': ['team', 'enterprise'],
  'private_skills': ['team', 'enterprise'],
  'usage_analytics': ['team', 'enterprise'],
  'priority_support': ['team', 'enterprise'],
  'sso_saml': ['enterprise'],
  'rbac': ['enterprise'],
  'audit_logging': ['enterprise'],
  'siem_export': ['enterprise'],
  'compliance_reports': ['enterprise'],
  'private_registry': ['enterprise'],
};
```

### 5.2 No Rate Limiting

```typescript
// What we DON'T do (usage limits)
// ❌ const MAX_INSTALLS_PER_MONTH = 100;
// ❌ const MAX_SEARCHES_PER_DAY = 500;
// ❌ async function checkUsageQuota() { ... }

// What we DO (feature gating)
// ✅ Core operations have no limits
async function searchSkills(query: string): Promise<Skill[]> {
  // No quota check - unlimited searches
  return await skillRepository.search(query);
}

async function installSkill(id: string): Promise<void> {
  // No quota check - unlimited installs
  await skillInstaller.install(id);
}

// ✅ Only check features for gated functionality
async function configureSSO(config: SSOConfig): Promise<void> {
  await requireFeature('sso_saml');  // Feature gate
  await ssoManager.configure(config);
}
```

- Generate SOC 2 compliance report (SMI-1046)

### 8.6 Design Principles

1. **No artificial limits** - Core features are unlimited
2. **Value-driven upgrades** - Only pay for features you need
3. **Developer-first** - Individual developers never pay
4. **Enterprise-justified** - Paid features serve real enterprise needs
5. **Clear boundaries** - Easy to understand what's in each tier

---

## Part 9: Key Differentiators

### 9.1 Why Feature Bifurcation Works

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Trust** | Developers recommend tools that won't surprise their company with bills |
| **Adoption** | No friction in free tier = faster spread within organizations |
| **Natural upsell** | Teams that need features will pay; no quotas needed |
| **Clear value** | SSO, RBAC, audit are obviously enterprise needs |
| **No resentment** | Developers don't hit walls while working |

### 9.2 Why NOT Usage Limits

| Problem | With Usage Limits | With Feature Bifurcation |
|---------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Power users | Hit limits, frustrated | Use freely, become advocates |
| Recommendations | Hesitate to recommend | Freely recommend |
| CI/CD usage | Quickly hit limits | No concern |
| Experimentation | Constrained | Encouraged |
| Upgrade path | Forced (quota hit) | Organic (feature need) |

## Appendix A: Shreyas Doshi Frameworks Referenced

### A.1 LNO Framework
- **L (Leverage)**: Work that disproportionately impacts outcomes
- **N (Neutral)**: Work that must be done but doesn't differentiate
- **O (Overhead)**: Work that should be minimized or eliminated

### A.2 Pre-Mortem
- Imagine the project failed; identify why
- Address highest-likelihood, highest-impact risks first

### A.3 High-Leverage Decisions
- Decisions that compound over time
- Focus energy on decisions that are hard to reverse
