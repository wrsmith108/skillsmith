## Misaligned Issues

### 1. Phase 4 Product Strategy Issues → Tier Reassignment

These Phase 4 issues need reassignment to commercial tiers:

| Issue | Title | Current | Recommended Tier |
|-------|-------|---------|------------------|
| SMI-844 | A/B Testing Infrastructure | Phase 4 | Team tier (Phase 7+) |
| SMI-910 | A/B Testing Infrastructure | Orphan | Duplicate - Close |
| SMI-909 | Analytics Instrumentation (Epic) | Orphan | Team tier (Phase 7+) |
| SMI-839 | Implement Skill Usage Analytics | Phase 4 | Team tier feature |
| SMI-846 | Build ROI Dashboard | Phase 4 | Enterprise tier feature |
| SMI-842 | [EPIC] Proof of Value | Phase 4 | Enterprise tier (ROI reporting) |

### 2. Phase 1 Static Site Issues → Marketing Website

| Issue | Title | Recommendation |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| SMI-597 | Set up Astro static site | Repurpose for marketing/docs site |
| SMI-598 | Build skill search page | Public search (Community tier) |
| SMI-599 | Build skill detail pages | Public detail pages |

**Decision Needed**: Is Astro the right choice for commercial marketing site?

### 3. Orphaned Issues Without Project

| Issue | Title | Recommendation |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| SMI-908 | First-Impression Skills Onboarding | Move to Phase 7 (Community) |
| SMI-909 | Analytics Instrumentation | Move to Phase 7 (Team tier) |
| SMI-910 | A/B Testing Infrastructure | Duplicate of SMI-844, close |

---

## Phase 5: Release & Publishing - CRITICAL PATH

Phase 5 is blocking commercialization. Issues need immediate attention:

| Issue | Title | Priority | Blocker For |
|-------|-------|----------|-------------|
| SMI-811 | Publish @skillsmith/mcp-server to npm | P0 | All tiers |
| SMI-812 | Publish @skillsmith/cli to npm | P0 | All tiers |
| SMI-814 | Publish @skillsmith/core to npm | P0 | All tiers |
| SMI-878 | Create GitHub App (15K req/hr) | P1 | Skill import at scale |

**Recommendation**: Prioritize Phase 5 before Phase 7.

---

## Execution Gaps

### Gap 1: No Phase 7 Project

- Private registry

---

### Gap 2: No Payment/Billing Infrastructure

**Missing Issues**:

---

### Gap 3: No Marketing Website

---

---

### Gap 7: No Sales/GTM Infrastructure
