# Worktree Manager

> **Attribution**: This skill is inspired by [@obra's using-git-worktrees skill](https://github.com/obra/superpowers/blob/main/skills/using-git-worktrees/SKILL.md) from the Superpowers repository and the [git worktree pattern](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/1052) documented in claude-code issues.

## Behavioral Classification

**Type**: Guided Decision

This skill guides you through worktree strategy selection based on your project's dependency patterns.

**Decision Points**:
1. Are your waves/tasks sequentially dependent or independent?
2. Single worktree (sequential) or multiple worktrees (parallel)?
3. Does your repo use git-crypt for encrypted files?

After decisions are made, worktree creation proceeds automatically.

---

## What This Skill Does

Creates and manages isolated git worktrees for parallel feature development while **preventing merge conflicts** in shared files like `packages/core/src/index.ts`.

**Key Features**:
1. Smart worktree creation with pre-configured export stubs
2. Rebase-first workflow to prevent conflict cascades
3. Shared file registry for conflict detection
4. Coordination protocol for multi-session development
5. **Wave-aware strategy selection** for agentic execution

---

## Prerequisites

- Git 2.20+ (for worktree support)
- This repository cloned locally
- Understanding of the monorepo structure
- Git-crypt installed and key available (if repo uses encrypted files)
- Varlock configured for secret management (optional but recommended)

---

## Quick Start

### Creating a New Worktree

```bash
# 1. Ensure you're on main and up-to-date
cd /path/to/your/repo
git checkout main && git pull origin main

# 2. If repo uses git-crypt, unlock BEFORE creating worktree
varlock run -- sh -c 'git-crypt unlock "${GIT_CRYPT_KEY_PATH/#\~/$HOME}"'

# 3. Create worktree directory (if not exists)
mkdir -p ../worktrees

# 4. Create worktree for your feature
git worktree add ../worktrees/feature-name -b feature/feature-name

# 5. Navigate to worktree
cd ../worktrees/feature-name

# 6. Verify encrypted files are readable (if applicable)
head -3 docs/architecture/standards.md
```

### Before Starting Work

**CRITICAL**: Check the shared files registry before modifying:

```bash
# Files that commonly cause merge conflicts:
cat << 'EOF'
SHARED FILES - Coordinate before modifying:
- packages/core/src/index.ts (exports)
- packages/core/package.json (dependencies)
- packages/mcp-server/src/index.ts (server exports)
- package.json (root dependencies)
- tsconfig.json (compiler options)
EOF
```

| [Conflict Prevention](./conflict-prevention.md) | Staggered exports, conflict resolution, merge workflow |

## Quick Reference

### Strategy Selection

| Pattern | When to Use | PR Strategy |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Single Worktree** | Sequential waves, shared state | Single PR for all waves |
| **Multiple Worktrees** | Independent waves, parallel work | One PR per wave |
| **Worktree per Chain** | Mixed dependencies | One PR per dependency chain |

### Resource Considerations

| Environment | Recommended Strategy | Max Parallel Agents |
|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| MacBook (laptop profile) | Single worktree | 2-3 |
| Workstation | 1-2 worktrees | 4-6 |
| Server/CI | Multiple worktrees | 8+ |

### Common Commands

```bash
# List all worktrees
git worktree list

# Sync worktree with main
git fetch origin main && git rebase origin/main

# Remove worktree after merge
git worktree remove ../worktrees/feature-name

# Prune stale references
git worktree prune
```

### Session Coordination

```bash
# Start of session - always rebase first
git fetch origin main
git rebase origin/main

# End of session - commit and push
git add -A && git status
git push origin $(git branch --show-current)
```

## Scripts

The skill includes helper scripts in `scripts/`:

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `worktree-create.sh` | Create a new worktree with branch |
| `worktree-status.sh` | Show status of all worktrees |
| `worktree-sync.sh` | Sync all worktrees with main |
| `worktree-cleanup.sh` | Clean up merged worktrees |
| `generate-launch-script.sh` | Generate Claude Code launch script |
