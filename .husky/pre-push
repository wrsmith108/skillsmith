# Pre-push hook: Security checks before pushing
# Issue: SMI-727
#
# This hook runs comprehensive security checks before allowing a push to remote.
# It helps prevent security vulnerabilities from reaching production.
#
# Configuration:
#   NO_VERIFY  - Set to skip hook (use with caution): git push --no-verify
#
# Checks performed:
#   1. Security test suite (packages/core/tests/security/)
#   2. npm audit (high severity or above)
#   3. Hardcoded secrets pattern detection
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - All security checks passed
#   1 - Security issues detected (push blocked)

# Run security checks
bash "$(dirname "$0")/../scripts/pre-push-check.sh"
